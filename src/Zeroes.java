    //his question is pretty straightforward.

    //Because all trailing 0 is from factors 5 * 2.

    //But sometimes one number may have several 5 factors, for example, 25 have two 5 factors, 125 have three 5 factors.
    //In the n! operation, factors 2 is always ample. So we just count how many 5 factors in all number from 1 to n.
