 * All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA,
 * it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

 Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

 For example,

 Given s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT",

 Return:
 ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"].

public class RepeatedDNA {
    public List<String> findRepeatedDnaSequences(String s) {
        return null;
    }
}
